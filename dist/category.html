        <p>Tarrare ([taʁaʁ]; c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled Tarar, was a French showman and soldier noted for his
            unusual appetite and eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents
            could not provide for him and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the
            company of a band of prostitutes and thieves before becoming the warm-up act for a travelling charlatan. In
            this act, he would swallow corks, stones, live animals, and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this
            act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.</p>
