        <h1>Appearance and behaviour</h1>
        <p>Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was slim and of average height. At the age of 17, he weighed only 100
            pounds (45 kg; 7 st 2 lb). He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide
            mouth (roughly four inches between his jaws when his mouth was fully extended), in which his teeth were
            heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin
            would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When
            full, his abdomen would distend "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung
            loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth.</p>

        <p>His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily; he constantly had foul body-odour; he was
            described as stinking "to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty
            paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would
            become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during
            which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He had chronic diarrhoea,
            which was said to be "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear
            either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no
            apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic
            temperament with "a complete lack of force and ideas".</p>

        <p>The cause of Tarrare's behaviour is not known. While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour
            from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied and there have been no modern
            documented cases resembling Tarrare. Hyperthyroidism can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss,
            profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare had a damaged
            amygdala; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce polyphagia. </p>
