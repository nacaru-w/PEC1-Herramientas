        <h1>Attempted cures</h1>
        <p>Following an incident during his military service, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further being in the army,
            and returned to the hospital, telling Dr Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite.
            Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine-vinegar and tobacco-pills were
            likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but
            this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he
            would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for
            carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking
            from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital's morgue. Other
            doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum,
            but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.</p>

        <p>After some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected.
            Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital-staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to
            which he never returned. </p>
