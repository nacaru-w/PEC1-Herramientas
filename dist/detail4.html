It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying shortly afterwards.</p> <figure> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mha-10HQOi4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> Documentary: <cite>The Bizarre Tale of Tarrare, the Man Who Was Always Hungry</cite>. 2021. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach.[21] His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity. The fork was never found.</p> <div class="category_section"> <h2>Further reading</h2> <ul> <li><a href="/detail1.html">Early life</a></li> <li><a href="/detail2.html">Appearance and behaviour</a></li> <li><a href="/detail3.html">Attempted cures</a></li> </ul> </div> </main> <footer> <div class="author">Made with ðŸ’™ by <a href="https://github.com/nacaru-w" title="Author's GitHub page">Nacho Casares</a> in November 2022</div> <div class="copyright">Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 2.0</a> </div> </footer> </body></html>
