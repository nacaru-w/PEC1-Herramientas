        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <p>Tarrare was born near Lyon, around 1772. His date of birth is unrecorded and it is not even known if Tarrare
            was his real name or a nickname.</p>

        <p>As a child, Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a bullock, weighing as much
            as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had
            forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves
            and prostitutes, stealing and begging for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling
            charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an
            entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of
            snake-meat.</p>

        <p>In 1788, Tarrare moved to Paris to work as a street performer. He appears to have been successful in general,
            but on one occasion, the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the
            crowd carried him to the HÃ´tel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full
            recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Â Giraud, the surgeon,
            was un-impressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the
            items. It was in this hospital where he met Dr Percy, who offered himself to find a cure to his condition.
            Tarrare rejected the offer. </p>
