        <p>Four years later, in 1798, a M.Â Tessier of Versailles hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient
            of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had
            swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current
            weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had
            advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous exudative diarrhoea, dying
            shortly afterwards.</p>

        <p>The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, wanted to
            find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was
            actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his
            jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach.[21] His body was found to be
            filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in
            ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity. The fork was never found.</p>
